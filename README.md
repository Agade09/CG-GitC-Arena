# CG-GitC-Arena
Arena program that plays games between two Ghost in the Cell AIs. **Linux only**.

## Usage:
* Compile the Arena program
* Compile two of your AIs
* Run the Arena program with the names of the AI binaries as command line parameters. e.g: Arena V13 V12

## Optional:
* Specify the number of threads as a command line parameter. e.g: Arena V13 V12 2
* Set timeout behavior on or off via the "constexpr bool Timeout" variable. This can be useful as I've noticed timeouts if the computer is being used for something else.
